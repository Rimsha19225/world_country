        <p>Zambia is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, bordered by eight other countries: Tanzania to the northeast, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe to the south, Botswana and Namibia to the southwest, Angola to the northwest, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north. The capital city is Lusaka, located in the southern part of the country, while Kitwe and Ndola are major urban centers in the Copperbelt region.</p>
        <p>Zambia has a population of approximately 19 million people, consisting of various ethnic groups, with the Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, and Lozi being some of the largest groups. The official language is English, but several local languages, such as Bemba, Nyanja, and Tonga, are widely spoken. The country has a relatively young population, with a significant portion under the age of 25.</p>
        <p>Zambia is a republic, with a multi-party system and a president serving as both the head of state and government. The political landscape has evolved since Zambia gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1964. The country was initially a one-party state under its first president, Kenneth Kaunda, but has since transitioned to a multi-party democracy. Zambia has made progress in maintaining political stability, although challenges such as corruption and inequality persist.</p>
        <p>Economically, Zambia is heavily dependent on mining, particularly copper, which is one of the world’s largest producers. The Copperbelt region is rich in copper deposits, and the mining industry has been the backbone of the country’s economy. In addition to copper, Zambia is also known for producing cobalt, gold, and other minerals. Agriculture is another important sector, with maize being the staple crop, along with other crops such as tobacco, cotton, and cassava. Tourism is growing, with visitors attracted to Zambia’s natural beauty, including Victoria Falls (shared with Zimbabwe) and national parks like South Luangwa National Park and Lower Zambezi National Park, known for their wildlife and safari experiences.</p>
        <p>Zambia’s geography is varied, with plateaus and hills in the central and southern regions, while the Zambezi River in the south forms the natural border with Zimbabwe and provides a vital water source. The northern part of the country is more tropical, with forested areas and a wetter climate. The climate is typically tropical with distinct wet and dry seasons, although it varies by region.</p>
        <p>Culturally, Zambia has a rich heritage that blends indigenous traditions with colonial influences. Music, dance, and storytelling are important aspects of Zambian culture, with traditional drumming and dance playing a prominent role in ceremonies and celebrations. Zambian cuisine is based on staple foods such as nsima (a maize-based dish similar to polenta), vegetables, and grilled meats.</p>
        <p>Despite challenges such as poverty, high unemployment, and periodic droughts, Zambia continues to show resilience in its pursuit of economic diversification, infrastructural development, and social improvements. The country is known for its peaceful political environment and has made significant strides in healthcare, education, and poverty reduction.</p>
