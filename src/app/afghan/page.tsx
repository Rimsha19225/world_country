        <p>Afghanistan is a landlocked country in South Asia and Central Asia, bordered by Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Its capital is Kabul, one of the country’s oldest cities and a cultural and economic hub. Afghanistan has a population of about 40 million people, with diverse ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks.</p>
        <p>Dari (Persian) and Pashto are the official languages, and Islam, particularly Sunni Islam, is the dominant religion. Afghanistan’s political landscape has been complex and unstable for decades, with recent changes as the Taliban regained control in 2021. This political shift has influenced Afghanistan governance, impacting its international relations and economic structure.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan economy relies heavily on agriculture, including products like wheat, fruits, and nuts, though opium production has also been a major source of income for some regions. The country is rich in untapped natural resources, including precious minerals like lithium, copper, and iron, which have the potential to boost its economy if developed. However, ongoing conflict, sanctions, and limited infrastructure pose significant economic challenges.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Afghanistan is mountainous, with the Hindu Kush range running through the country, creating natural beauty and barriers. The country’s landscape also includes desert regions, fertile valleys, and rivers, such as the Amu Darya and Kabul River. Its rugged terrain has historically made transportation and development challenging.</p>
        <p>Culturally, Afghanistan has a rich heritage, with traditions in music, poetry, art, and crafts. Ancient sites like the Buddhas of Bamiyan (destroyed in 2001), Herat’s Blue Mosque, and the Minaret of Jam reflect Afghanistan’s deep historical roots. Afghan cuisine, known for dishes like kebabs, rice pilafs, naan, and the savory mantu dumplings, reflects Central Asian and South Asian influences.</p>
        <p>Despite ongoing hardships, Afghanistan history, cultural resilience, and natural beauty make it a country of unique significance in the region.</p>
