        <p>Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, spans Eastern Europe and northern Asia, covering over 17 million square kilometers. It shares borders with 14 countries, including China, Ukraine, and Norway, and has extensive coastlines along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Moscow, its capital, is a major cultural and political center, while other notable cities include Saint Petersburg, Kazan, and Vladivostok.</p>
        <p>With a population of approximately 146 million, Russia is a multi-ethnic nation, home to various ethnic groups, languages, and religions. Russian is the official language, and the Russian Orthodox Church is the predominant religious institution, although the country includes Muslim, Buddhist, and Jewish communities.</p>
        <p>Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic, with President Vladimir Putin as a central figure in its political landscape. Historically influential, Russia emerged as a major power after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, leading to a transition from a communist system to a more market-oriented economy. However, Russia’s economy remains heavily reliant on natural resources, particularly oil, gas, and minerals, which make it a leading global exporter. While these resources fuel economic growth, the economy also faces challenges, including sanctions, income inequality, and an overreliance on energy exports.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Russia’s vast landscape includes diverse features, from the Siberian tundra and the Ural Mountains to fertile plains and extensive forested areas. Russia is home to Lake Baikal, the world’s deepest freshwater lake, and vast wilderness that supports rich biodiversity.</p>
        <p>Russian culture is deeply rooted in its literature, music, ballet, art, and cinema. Russian writers like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Pushkin are celebrated worldwide, and institutions like the Bolshoi Ballet and Mariinsky Theatre are renowned in classical arts. Russian cuisine includes dishes like borscht, pelmeni, and blini, reflecting both European and Asian influences.</p>
        <p>Russia’s global influence, historical significance, and cultural contributions make it a major player on the world stage. However, its international relationships, particularly with Western nations, are often complex and marked by geopolitical tension.</p>
