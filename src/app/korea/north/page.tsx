        <p>North Korea, with its capital Pyongyang, is a totalitarian state ruled by the Kim dynasty. It is one of the most secretive countries in the world, with strict control over its citizens and a centralized economy. The country’s population is approximately 25 million, and the official language is Korean. North Korea economy is largely state-controlled, and while it has significant natural resources, it faces challenges such as limited access to international markets due to global sanctions and isolationist policies. The country has made headlines for its nuclear weapons program, which has led to tensions with South Korea, the United States, and other nations.</p>
        <p>North Korea’s landscape includes mountains, plains, and a temperate climate similar to South Korea’s, but it is less developed, with many rural areas lacking infrastructure. While the culture is influenced by Confucianism and Korean traditions, North Korea state ideology, Juche, emphasizes self-reliance and loyalty to the ruling family, which has shaped its art, education, and societal structure.</p>
