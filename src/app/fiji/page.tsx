        <p>Fiji is an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, located about 1,100 miles northeast of New Zealand. Comprising over 330 islands, with only around 100 inhabited, Fiji is known for its pristine beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant coral reefs, making it a popular destination for tourists seeking tropical getaways. The two largest islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, hold the majority of the population and are economic centers. The capital, Suva, is located on Viti Levu and serves as the political, cultural, and economic hub of the country.</p>
        <p>With a population of around 900,000, Fiji is a multicultural nation, primarily made up of Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, descendants of Indian laborers brought by the British during the colonial era. The official languages are English, Fijian, and Hindi, reflecting Fiji’s ethnic diversity. Fiji is a parliamentary democracy, with a president as the head of state and a prime minister leading the government.</p>
        <p>Fiji’s economy is based on tourism, agriculture, and exports of sugar, fish, and water. The tourism sector is one of its main sources of income, attracting visitors for its diving spots, eco-resorts, and cultural experiences. Agriculture, particularly sugarcane, remains vital to the economy, although the country has been exploring renewable energy and sustainable development initiatives to reduce reliance on imports and ensure environmental preservation.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Fiji’s islands feature rugged mountains, tropical rainforests, and coastal mangroves, with warm temperatures year-round. The coral reefs surrounding Fiji are among the world’s most extensive, supporting diverse marine life and drawing diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. However, like many Pacific nations, Fiji faces environmental challenges from rising sea levels and climate change, which threaten its low-lying areas.</p>
        <p>Culturally, Fiji is known for its traditional arts, music, and dance. Indigenous customs, such as the yaqona (kava) ceremony and communal gatherings, play a vital role in Fijian society. Fijian cuisine features local staples like root vegetables, coconut, seafood, and tropical fruits, with dishes like kokoda (marinated fish) highlighting the nation’s oceanic resources.</p>
        <p>Fiji’s mix of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and welcoming hospitality makes it a unique and beloved destination in the Pacific, while its active role in environmental advocacy has established it as a leader among small island nations facing climate challenges.</p>
