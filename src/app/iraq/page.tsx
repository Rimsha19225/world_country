        <p>Iraq, located in the heart of the Middle East, is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. It also has a coastline along the Persian Gulf. The capital is Baghdad, which is the largest city and serves as the country cultural, political, and economic center. With a population of about 42 million, Iraq is ethnically diverse, with the majority being Arabs, alongside significant Kurdish, Turkmen, and Assyrian populations. The majority of Iraqis are Shia Muslims, with Sunni Muslims and other religious minorities also present. Arabic and Kurdish are the official languages.</p>
        <p>Iraq’s rich history dates back thousands of years to ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, who thrived in the fertile crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Iraq is often referred to as the cradle of civilization due to its contributions to writing, mathematics, and law. The country was united in the 20th century, gaining independence from British rule in 1932, and was ruled by Saddam Hussein from 1979 until his removal in 2003 following a U.S.-led invasion.</p>
        <p>The economy of Iraq is heavily dependent on oil, which accounts for most of the country’s revenue. Agriculture and industry also play roles in the economy, though Iraq faces challenges such as underdeveloped infrastructure and political instability. The country has faced significant hardships, including years of conflict, sectarian violence, and the rise of ISIS. Despite these challenges, Iraq continues to make efforts toward stabilization, reconstruction, and improving security.</p>
        <p>Iraq culture is rich with historical landmarks, such as the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, and is deeply influenced by its Arab and Islamic heritage. Iraqi cuisine features dishes like kebab, masgouf, and dolma, and the country is home to a vibrant tradition of music and poetry.</p>
