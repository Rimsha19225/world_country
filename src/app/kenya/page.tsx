        <p>Kenya is a country located in East Africa, bordered by Ethiopia to the north, Somalia to the east, Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, and South Sudan to the northwest. To the southeast, Kenya has a coastline along the Indian Ocean. The capital city is Nairobi, which serves as the economic, political, and cultural hub of the country. Another major city is Mombasa, located on the coast, which is an important port and tourist destination. Kenya has a population of approximately 54 million people.</p>
        <p>Kenya is a republic with a multi-party system, and the president is both the head of state and government. Since gaining independence from Britain in 1963, Kenya has had a complex political history, with periods of one-party rule, democratic reforms, and a push toward greater political freedom. The country is known for its vibrant democracy, although it faces challenges such as corruption, inequality, and political violence at times. Swahili and English are the official languages, and there are over 40 ethnic groups in Kenya, with the Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Maasai, and Kalenjin being some of the largest.</p>
        <p>Economically, Kenya is one of the largest and most diverse economies in East Africa. It has a mixed economy with agriculture, services, and industry all playing significant roles. Agriculture is a cornerstone of the economy, with tea, coffee, and horticultural products being key exports. Kenya is also known for its production of cut flowers, especially roses, which are a major export. The country has made strides in industrialization, with growing sectors like manufacturing, construction, and information technology. Tourism is another vital industry, driven by the country’s national parks, wildlife, beaches, and rich cultural heritage.</p>
        <p>Kenya is renowned for its wildlife and is home to many iconic species such as elephants, lions, giraffes, and rhinos. The country has a number of world-famous national parks and reserves, including Masai Mara, Amboseli National Park, and Tsavo National Park, which attract tourists from around the world for safaris and eco-tourism. Kenya is also a key player in the global marathon running scene, producing some of the world’s best long-distance runners.</p>
        <p>The geography of Kenya is diverse, ranging from the Great Rift Valley in the west to the coastal plains along the Indian Ocean. The central region has mountains, including Mount Kenya, the second-highest peak in Africa. The country’s climate varies depending on the region, from tropical on the coast to temperate in the highlands. Nairobi, for example, has a moderate climate due to its elevation.</p>
        <p>Kenya culture is rich and varied, influenced by its ethnic diversity. Traditional music, dance, and art are integral parts of Kenyan life. Maasai culture is particularly well-known globally, with their distinctive clothing, jewelry, and traditional pastoral lifestyle. Kenyan cuisine includes staple foods such as ugali (a maize-based dish), nyama choma (grilled meat), and sukuma (collard greens). The country is also famous for its tea and coffee, both of which play a significant role in Kenyan culture and economy.</p>
        <p>Kenya faces several development challenges, including poverty, unemployment, and corruption, but it is steadily progressing in infrastructure, education, and healthcare. The country has also invested in technology and innovation, with Nairobi emerging as a regional tech hub, known as Silicon Savannah. Kenya’s young and dynamic population, combined with its natural resources and strategic location, provides strong potential for continued growth and development.</p>
