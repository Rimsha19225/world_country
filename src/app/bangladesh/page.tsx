        <p>Bangladesh is a South Asian country bordered by India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. Its capital is Dhaka, a vibrant city known for its history, culture, and rapid urban growth. Bangladesh has a population of around 170 million, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</p>
        <p>The official language is Bengali (Bangla), and Islam is the predominant religion, practiced by over 90% of the population. Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy, with a government led by a prime minister and a ceremonial president.</p>
        <p>Economically, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress over recent decades, transitioning from a primarily agricultural economy to one where textiles and garments are significant contributors. The ready-made garment (RMG) industry is a key driver of economic growth and one of the largest in the world, providing employment to millions, especially women. The country has also seen growth in remittances and the service sector, although it still faces challenges like poverty and infrastructure needs.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Bangladesh is characterized by its river delta landscape, formed by the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna rivers, which contribute to the country’s fertile lands. However, it is also prone to flooding and other climate-related challenges due to its low-lying geography. The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the world’s largest mangrove forest, is home to the Bengal tiger and a significant ecological treasure.</p>
        <p>Bangladesh has a rich cultural heritage that includes traditional music, dance, art, and festivals like Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year) and Eid celebrations. Bengali cuisine is known for its flavorful rice and fish dishes, biryani, and sweets like rasgulla and sandesh.</p>
        <p>Despite its challenges, Bangladesh continues to make strides in development, with a strong focus on women’s empowerment, healthcare, and education. Its resilience and dynamic growth make it a key player in South Asia.</p>
