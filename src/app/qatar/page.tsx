        <p>Qatar is a small, wealthy country on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, bordered by Saudi Arabia and surrounded by the Persian Gulf. Its capital, Doha, is a modern, rapidly growing city known for its impressive skyline, luxury shopping, and cultural landmarks. Qatar has a population of about 3 million, with the majority being expatriates from South Asia, the Philippines, and other countries, as Qatari citizens make up a small portion of the population.</p>
        <p>Qatar is a hereditary monarchy ruled by the Al Thani family, with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani currently leading the country. The official language is Arabic, and Islam is the state religion, though Qatar is known for its openness to other cultures and religious tolerance among its large expatriate population.</p>
        <p>Qatar has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, largely due to its vast reserves of natural gas and oil. The country is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has driven its rapid economic growth. To reduce dependency on oil and gas, Qatar has been diversifying its economy through investments in sectors like tourism, finance, and education, highlighted by projects such as the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Qatar is mainly flat and arid, with a desert landscape and a hot, dry climate. The country is known for its stunning desert scenery, including the Khor Al Adaid, or Inland Sea, a unique natural reserve where sand dunes meet the sea.</p>
        <p>Qatari culture is rooted in Bedouin traditions, evident in its hospitality, art, and national dress. The country has invested significantly in cultural infrastructure, including the Museum of Islamic Art and the National Museum of Qatar. Qatar’s culinary scene features traditional dishes like machboos (spiced rice with meat) and a range of international cuisines reflecting its diverse population.</p>
        <p>Qatar gained global recognition as the first Middle Eastern country to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, which showcased its infrastructure and commitment to positioning itself as a prominent global player in sports and culture.</p>
