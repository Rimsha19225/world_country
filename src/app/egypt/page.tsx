        <p>Egypt, located in northeastern Africa and extending into the Middle East via the Sinai Peninsula, is one of the oldest and most culturally rich civilizations in the world. It is bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, Israel and the Gaza Strip to the northeast, and has coastlines along the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Cairo, Egypt bustling capital, is one of the largest cities in Africa and a major cultural and historical center, known for its ancient monuments and vibrant life.</p>
        <p>With a population of around 109 million, Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. Arabic is the official language, and Islam, specifically Sunni Islam, is the predominant religion, though Egypt also has a significant Christian minority, primarily Coptic Christians. Egypt is a republic, with a presidential system, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is the current head of state.</p>
        <p>Egypt’s economy is diverse, with sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism playing significant roles. The Suez Canal is a vital global trade route that links the Mediterranean and Red Seas, providing Egypt with substantial revenue. The tourism sector, which showcases Egypt’s ancient monuments, including the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor and Karnak, is essential to the economy, although it has faced challenges due to regional instability and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Geographically, Egypt is largely desert, with the Nile River running from south to north and providing fertile land along its banks. The Nile Valley and Delta are the heart of Egypt’s agricultural activity, where crops like cotton, wheat, and rice are cultivated. The vast desert regions contain oases and ancient rock formations, and Egypt’s coastline offers beautiful beaches and coral reefs, attracting tourists to areas like Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada.</p>
        <p>Egyptian culture is rich and steeped in history, with influences from the ancient pharaohs, Islamic traditions, and the Arab world. Ancient Egyptian civilization is celebrated worldwide, with contributions in art, architecture, science, and literature. Egyptian cuisine is known for dishes like koshari (a mix of rice, pasta, and lentils), ful medames (fava beans), and tahini.</p>
        <p>Egypt’s strategic location, ancient heritage, and modern influence make it a significant country in both African and Middle Eastern affairs, shaping its role as a cultural, political, and economic leader in the region.</p>
